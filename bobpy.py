# variables syntax for python (# represents a comment)
# variable names should not start with special character eg, #number, @number, $number, %number
# variable names should not start with a number for example, 1number, 2number
# however number 1 is a valif syntax
# a variable name should not have spaces for example, you cannot my age, my name
# names that are composite, they should be sperated by underscore,for example my_name, my_age
# if you are not using underscore, you use camel-case, for example, myAge, myName
# names should not start with capital letters, unless they are functions or classes. for example, Myname
# we should use relatable names, for example, when dealing with a customer, call them mycustomer, when dealing with numbers use num1, num2,
# use shorter names, for example, cus instead of customer, age for my age, sal for salary
# variable names should not be repeated in different forms because python is case sensitive, for example, "Name" and "name" are not the same
age = 41
name = "bob"
school = "refacory"
print(school)
print(name)
# cdecalaring variable is a process of naming memory spaces (baptsising a variable)
# initializing variables is a process of giving variables values, for example, age is a variable, 41 is its value
country = "Uganda"
# equal sign in programming is used to give values a meaning 
# the symbol "=" that we use to give a variabel a value is called assginment
