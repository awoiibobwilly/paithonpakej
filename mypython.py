#ASSIGNMENT 12th March 2024

#Programming is the art and science of writing computer instruction

#This programming follows guidelines which are well proven

#The common factors between Computer and Human Language

# This programming instructs the computer to do something

#The memory of a computer is where information is stored

#The Two important components of the computer are the

#1. Memory
#2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)

#The common thing between Computer and Human

#1. Both have the brain, though the brain of a computer is Central Processing Unit (CPU)
#2. Both have Housing, though for human being is the body
#3. Both have Memory
#4. Both take instructions
#5. Both  give output after executing the instruction

#The Central Processing Unit (CPU) executes the instruction

#There is synchronization between the memory and the Central Processing Uni, meaning that they work together or rather in harmony.

#The types of memories of the computer

#1. Optical Memory, which is a type of memory written using light.
#2. Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Memory, which is a type of memory written using Electrmagnetic Fields.
#3. Flash Drive Memory, which is a type of memory written by copying.


#MEMORIES OF A COMPUTER INTERMS OF THEIR RELEVANCE.

#1. Primary Memory, this is a type of memory is inside the computer
#2. Secondary Memory, this is a type of memory is outside the computer (or external to the computer)
#3. Random Access Memory (RAM), this is a type of memory stores random things

#Examples of memory;

#1. Internal Memory (Random Access Memory - RAM, Hard Disk Drive - HDD)
#2. External Memory (Flash Drive


#The CPU cannot communicate directly to memory.

#The RAM is empty when the computer is switched off, but active when the a file is opened

#Buffer Storage is another type of memory in the computer

#The HDD which is circular in nature Rotates in a clockwise direction, it rotates from the inner to the outer

#The HDD memory is circular in nature, it is metallic, and Electromagnetic

#The HDD needs to be partitioned before, this is a good practice, these partitions can then later be named for easy identification.

#After partitioning of the HDD, each memory segment will be having a unique identifier, for example, it could be xd1, xd2, xd3 etc. So the xd1, xd2 etc are memory addresses where information is store. Since remembering this unique identifier can be very taxing, we give names for to thes memories space, for example, we can call it D, E, F etc, or even simply call it Bob.

#Interaction between CPU, RAM, Cache and the HDD memory

#Since the CPU does not communicate directly with the HDD which is the main memory space of the computer, it will interact with the HDD through the RAM which gets information from the HDD and relays the information to the the CPU.

#For the interaction of CPU, RAM, Cache, Buffer and HDD; let's say a power point file is opened, for the program to stay opened, it will be using the buffer, but hwne you begin to type on it, it will use the RAM and if you decide to save the file, it will be kept in the HDD, the program iself is resident in the HDD; again if you opened that very file several times, the computer will realize that you use that file so often, so another memory will be kept on the Cache, though this memory is just for file path. Another example, I like playing scrable, so I open Scrable on the PC, the Scrable program itself is resident in the HDD, so when the program is opened, it will be using RAM as long as I am playing the game (Scrable), once I am done playing and I decide to to close the program, and if it was the only program opened at that momenet, the RAM will be empty without being occupied. Another example, if have a Movie I would like to watch, that movie could be in another memory address but within HDD, and the Program itself which could be Media Plaer, as I decide to play this movie, the Movie A from memory address address xd123 will be loaded in Media Player B in memory address xd124, so at this moment the Buffer will be in use, as the Movie B begins to play, for it to play, the RAM will be in use as long as the Movie is playing.

#In programming we will be creating names to be given instead of the unique identifiers (numbers)

#As a programmer I target manupulating the memories in the computer.

#HISTORY OF PYTHON as a Programming Language

#A Dutch gentleman called Guido Van Rossum founded Python Software
#There a Python Software Foundation that gathers Python Software communities from all over the world
#I am glad that my Python Coach only and only Ozzy is part of that foundation, and he is the President of the Python Software Foundation in East Africa.
#Python traces its origin from C which is one of the first languages, thus C is the mother of all languages.
#Python was discovered by Van Russom while watching "Monte Python", one of the old and legen comic shows in the USA, he discovered Python after watching this show, and that's the origin of the, however, he had worked on another project before where he was trying to make C better, his first Project was abc, which later on became Python.

#Pyhton is a Fourth Generation programming language, meaning that Python is very similar to or rather near to human language.

#Examples of Applications using Python

#1. Dropbox
#2. Firefox
#3. Google Search

#Some of the Advantages of Python over the rest of the programming languages

#1. Easy to learn/Flat Learning Curve
#2. Object oriented programming
#3. Fourth Generation programming language
#4. Multipurpose programming language (Networking, Data Science, Web Application)

#When we are dealing with the computer, we need to know that it only understands binary programming language.

#Below are two important Principles of programming languages

#1. Interpretation 
#2. Computaion 

#Thus Python is an Interpreted Language while JavaScript and C++ are Computational Languages

#SYNTAX is the rule that governs the programming language, as opposed to to the rule that goverrns human language, which is grammar.

#Computer Languages are written while Huaman Languages are both Interpreted and Written.

#There are two distinct things that about Python

#1. Versions
#2. Distributions

#Yes, there are different versions of Python, yet within that vers of Python we have different distributions; for example, 3.2 can be a version of Python, while 3.2.1, 3.2.2 etc are the different distributions within that same version of 3.2

#Anything you put in a quote is output in the same way, for example

#name="bob" will be output in the same way as bob.

#Statement is a complete instruction to a computer.
#Two or more statements make a program

#Things that we will learn in the next few days are;

#1. Variables
#2. Operators
#3. Operants

#Variables are names programmers give to the memory of the computer

#A python file is called Python Script

#We can use different avenues to give a python command, for example

#1. IDLE 
#2. VSCode
#3. The Command Prompt

#In writing this python script I have used a VSCode.

#Examples of commands that can be written

#1. >>> a = 82
#2. >>> b = 137
#3. >>> print (a + b)

#The output of the command print is 219

#One or more groups of codes make a program  

#A named memory space is called a variable

#In programming, and to be specific, with Python, when you start a statement with "#", the computer wil ignore, and that is called a comment.
#So, if you write a statement starting with "#", with the purpose of helping you understand the meaning of what you are doing, the computer will not excecute it.


#DATA TYPES IN PYTHON 

#These are Different kinds of data we store in the memory
# These Data types helps us to efficiently use memory so that we are not wasteful with the limited or available memory spaces we have.
    
# Data types are different kinds of data that we store in memory

# DATA TYPES THAT WE HAVE COVERED

# 1- Numeric types
# 2- String types
# 3- Sequence types
# 4- Mapping types
# 5- Boolean types
# 6- Set types

# NUMERIC TYPES
# Integer is written as (int); float as (float) and complex as (complex)
# EXAMPLES

#Integer = 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 (num1 = 3+7)
#Float = 5.5, 10.5, 20.5, 30.5, 40.5 (num2 = 3.5 + 7.5)
#Complex = 5.5j, 10.5j, 20.5j, 30.5j, 40.5j (num3 = 3+7j)


#This is 11/04/2024 Class 


#STRING

#town = 'Masaka', 'Masaka is a string

#1. List
#2. Tuples 
#3. Range 

# List = (23, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30)

#List is a memory space where we store more than one value.

#A list is a variable that can store more than one value, but this can also allow to have an empty list, this enables us to to decalare an empty list that is waiting for values to be store in it.

#Example of an empty list list = [] 

#Append is a special command that adds values to a list

#list = [30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
#print(list)
#list.append(130)
#print(list)
#list = [30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130]

#To return the value 130 in the list, I would command

#print(list[10])

#This will return the value 130 from the list
#To get the position of any number in the list, you get the total number of values minus (-) one (1)
#list = [30 (1), 40(2), 50(3), 60(4), 70(5), 80(6), 90(7), 100(8), 110(9), 120(10), 130(11)]
#Though 70 is number 5 in the list, it is in position (5-1); thus it is position 4

#When getting positions in the list, we can read positions from the left to right or from the right to left

#For example, for the list district = [Kampala, Kasese, Kamengo, Kabale[Kotido, Kaabong,[Kumi,[Kisoro]]]

#district = ['Kampala', 'Kasese', 'Kamengo', 'Kabale',['Kotido', 'Kaabong',['Kumi',['Kwen','Kisoro']]]]

#Indexing Kisoro from left to right is print(district[4][2][1][1])

#Indexing Kisoro from right to left print(district[-1][-1][-1][-1])


#tuples are immutable datadtypes, meaning that you can't change it


#set types (an unordered collection of unique values)
#A set is a collection of unique values or items

#inos= {111,112,113,114,115,116,117,117} is a set, mea

#on printing idnos, it returns {112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 111} which is different from in arranagement to inos= {111,112,113,114,115,116,117,117}, because the index of 111 has totally changed when printed.


#statement is a complete instruction to the computer
#two or more statements make a code
#sentence is signle 
#operator tells the computer to do something with the variable

#name = 'Awoii Bob Willy'

#name represents the name of the variable
#= gives the intruction to the computer what to do


#debugging is the process of looking for errors in your code

#Different types of operators with their meanings
#Arithmetic Operators (e.g. +, -, *,)

#For example, num1 = 101, num2 = 200

#In the sum = num1 + num2 which means num1 plus (+) num2


#floor division means diving a number and returing an integer; for example when a = 2 and b = 3 floordiv =  a//b, print(a//b) will return 0 instead of 0.6667

#Exponential/power  (a**b), this means a to the power of b; for example, 2**2 is equal to 4


#modulo/modulus (%) this returns the remainder one number divided by one another, for example, when a = 4 and b = 8, print (a%b) returns 4
