#statement is a complete instruction to the computer
#two or more statements make a code
#sentence is signle 
#operator tells the computer to do something with the variable

name = 'Awoii Bob Willy'

#name represents the name of the variable
#= gives the intruction to the computer what to do


#debugging is the process of looking for errors in your code

#Different types of operators with their meanings
#Arithmetic Operators (e.g. +, -, *,)

num1 = 101

print (div)

#floor division

#Exponential/power  (a**b)
print(num1**2)

#modulo/modulus (%) this returns the remainder one number divided by one another

#Other sets of operators

#Assignment Operators (e.g. =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, **=, %=)

num3 = num1 + num2

num1 += 2 #num1 = num1 + 2 Additional Assignment

print (num1)

num2 -= 2 #num2 = num2  2 Subtraction Assignment

num1 *= 2 #num1 = num1 * 2 Multiplication Assignment

print (num1)

#Boolean data types (True, False; yes, no)

#at least each sentence will have an operator as we do programming

#Membership Operators are in/out of

list2 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

print(10 in list2)

print(60 in list2)

print(70 not in list2)

#IDENTIFIER Operators (IDENTITY OPERATOR)

list3 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

print(list2 is not list3)
print(list2 is list3)

#A statement that evaluates to a value is called an expression
#For example, line 146 'list2 is not list3' is a statement that evaluates to a value of 'True or False'
#A value in programming is called an operant
#For example, in line 144 [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] are operants
#An operant is what operator acts upon, Operator is what tell the computer to do with the operant
#Operators act upon Operants


#There is a scenario when you want to tell a computer until the response is fales
#However we have to tell the computer to stop
#Hot to tell a computer to count numbers until a certain number is reached
#Hot to tell a computer to perform a certain task until a condition is met, this process is called a 'loop'

#DIFFERENT LOOPS AND THEIR MEANINGS IN PROGRAMMING
#We can look through 

#This is the way we tell the computer to do something until a certain condition is met (fales)
